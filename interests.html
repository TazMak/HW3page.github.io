                My interests span across various domains, each contributing to my personal growth and shaping my 
                worldview. One of my primary passions is technology and how it changes the world in relation to Finances. I'm fascinated by how a 
                few lines of code can create beautiful, functional websites that millions of people can access. 
                Learning how to code has opened up a world of possibilities, and I'm constantly amazed 
                by the ever changing Fintech landscape.

                Beyond the digital realm, I love to play sports. Especially Tennis and Basketball. These sports are games that I have learned and improved on since I was a kid. 
                I see sports as a form of creative expression. Almost like a dance. From simply shooting the basketball to playing as a team, making tactics and trying to beat a 
                defender to try and score. From dribbling the basketball to doing elite pro moves, trying to catch a defender off guard to create enough space to score, it is very
                much a dance, as well as a  of competition.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I'm also passionate about continuous learning and self-improvement. I regularly read books, 
                try to learn new things, and participate in community events to expand my knowledge and skills. The world is constantly 
                evolving, and I want to evolve with it. Whether it's learning a new programming language, understanding 
                design principles, or exploring ways to improve my hand-eye coordination, I'm always excited to dive into something new.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Physical wellness is another important aspect of my life. I believe in maintaining a healthy balance 
                between mental and physical activities. Regular exercise, outdoor activities, and mindfulness practices 
                help me stay focused and energized. This approach to life ensures that I can pursue my passions 
                with enthusiasm and sustainability.
